(W. 2) Heidegger and the Technology of Writing

Heidegger´s Question strikes me as an argument ultimately concerning the technology of the written word. No sort of Enframing can seem as pervasive and as transformative as the ordering and destining with which writing turns experience – time itself – into a standing-reserve – a timeless space that can be accessed and perused in any direction. Objects lose their objectiveness and become essences as soon as they are written down. The very form of Heidegger’s thought – its lexical creativity, the modulations of meaning accomplished through specific combinations of roots and particles – reminds us of both the power and the danger intrinsic to its medium. I think that this reflection specifically relates to writing, and that it should not be generalized to the entirety of language itself – which is originally oral, and therefore both analogue (as Hayles taught us last week) and temporal. Referring to Winner, how confidently can we suppose a specific set of political forms connected with the technology of writing – and depending on issues related to the diffusion of writing, such as literacy and print? How would changes in our writing practices, due to either material or cultural factors, eventually condition these forms? Think, for instance, of the hybridization between oral and written modes happening every day in chats and social networks – verba that, constantly and silently, like scripta, manent.
