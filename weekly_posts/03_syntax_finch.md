#Syntax - Which Way Does The River Flow?

Located along one of the liveliest sections of the High Line, _The River That Flows Both Ways_ is an art installation that the casual visitor could easily overlook. On a preexisting building bordering the second floor of Chelsea Market, artist Spencer Finch has replaced the panes of seven adjacent windows with a series of colored glass sheets, ranging from dark brown to bright blue. The ensemble is supposed to depict the change in shades of the river Hudson over the course of a day. In order to render this temporal succession, Finch spent a day navigating the river, taking a picture every minute; then, following his personal taste, he picked a pixel from each picture, and accordingly tinted each windowpane with a color from the selection. My immediate preoccupation, while examining the piece for the first time, concerned its readability: the panes visibly follow a top-to-bottom chronological arrangement, identical for each window, but no clear indication is given about the horizontal progression. Has the artist arranged the sheets following a conventional left-to-right or right-to-left organization? Did he opt for a “bustrophedic” alternation, reminiscent of the origins of handwriting? Or, finally, did he privilege the specific transitions between colors, from an inherently aesthetic perspective, rather than respecting the archival organization of the whole (Tagg 30)? Is it possible to conceive a “list”, even at this primitive level of mimesis, that does not respond to a “positional” economy? Is “syntax” always and exclusively a spatial translation of a temporal sequence?
