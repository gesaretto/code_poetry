Krapp's Reel and Dictionary - Again for the specificity of writing

As I encountered the word "viduity", while reading Beckett's short play, my instinct was precisely the same as the one experienced by the character on stage, old Krapp - my ideal gaze started, interrupted the course of its activity, moved backwards for a moment, and slowly parsed again the unknown term, while I wondered about its meaning. Unlike Krapp, however, I had no need of consulting any dictionary because, as soon as my point of view was lifted from the close progression of the narrative - for the dense stage directions had done just that, they had paradoxically succeeded in transforming the necessarily deficient printed form of a dramatic monologue into the self-sufficient illusion of a narrative -, I realized, just by almost casually glancing at the upcoming lines, that the clarification about the strange word would come to me from the page itself. Had I been watching the piece in a theater, as it was arguably supposed to be enjoyed, my attention would have probably attempted an analogous jump - only to be immediately reincorporated into the flow of the dramatic action by the sympathetic uncertainty displayed by the actor on stage. My connection with the printed version of Beckett's text instead produced a combination of Krapp's "stop-and-rewind" usage of the audio reel with his efficient looking up and skimming through a ledger first and a dictionary later: when it became necessary, the temporal stream of the first was substituted by the spatial overlook of the second.
I think that this alternation between the discrete and the continuous (Weaver 12) and between succession and simultaneity (McLuhan 13) is peculiar to writing, and that it still deserves much consideration. I find it hard to categorize writing - handwriting or print - along other media by following principles of unit (analog or digital - a telephone against a telegraph) or temporality (punctual or durative - a painting against a film), but I believe in the usefulness of this effort, especially when facing the questions posed by the proliferation of new media - which further expand and problematize this ambiguity.
