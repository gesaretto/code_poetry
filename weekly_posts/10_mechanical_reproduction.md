Mechanical reproduction ought to liberate art from the dangerous manipulability of the most reactionary conceits traditionally associated to it, such as the uniqueness of creative genius or the sacred aura of the original masterpiece. A work that is entirely reproducible cannot supposedly be any longer the object of a cult – it has been entirely penetrated and discerned, its mystic spell being broken down and finally revealed as a combination of gestures, simple in their discrete existence, whose aesthetically enjoyable arrangement, however elaborate, has been obtained within the recognizable circumstances of human labor. The patent illusion of film editing, with its clever and yet very perceivable cuts, constitutes the most obvious example of this disenchantment.
The two insights that we have been offered about contemporary literary philology, however, seem to  imply forms of interpretation that still depend on an inextricable connection between artistic production, creative genius, and the aura of authenticity. The editor of a text is still paradoxically endowed with the task of recovering its waning aura, an objective now achieved through two opposing strategies. On the one hand, the fragmentary and tentative manifestations of a work are again transformed, cut and assembled in order to obtain a combination that is as aesthetically flawless as possible; syntax becomes the atemporal site for a platonic idea of the text, independent from its material instances and, like a magic formula, eternally powerful, regardless of the number of its manual or mechanical repetitions. On the other hand, through the reiterated juxtaposition of variations and their analysis, philology strives to gain a acquire of the author at work: it reconstructs the context of a genesis that is again treated as mythical, the moment when an ineffable intuition first became a tangible effort.
