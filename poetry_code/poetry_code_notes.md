#Short paper project: Poetry is Code

> From _writing_, to _print_, to _code_

##Issues to be addressed

1. _Syntax_ as the threshold between _temporal_ and _spatial_ (_analogue_ and _digital_?)

##The question therefore being

1. Combining these two ideas - a task that might be very much impossible:

    1. __Poetry *is* code__;
    
    1. __Syntax__ as the essential feature of _writing_.
    
1. Writing as a technology that questions the _flux_; writing as the stable _flux_ - the pictures taken by Finch, arranged to represent the linearity of the Hudson River. _Syntax_ as __time__ becoming space; _syntax_ as a _flux_ become static and forever accessible.


##A possible experiment

Treat the flux of poetry as _code_ using some combination of the commands learnt in the lab; try and make it _readable_.

We have to deal with the reciprocity of the human / machine interaction in a new way; we have to let the human interact with the machine in a new way. An easy way in which the machine can process poetry.

Treating the contents of _poetry_ as _information_. An instance of _cross-breeding_ between __Hamlet__ and __Wilhelm Tell__. 

##Mixing two posts

###Is Poetry Code?

Is poetry code? That is – is poetry norm, prescription, a set of instructions used to shape a specific knowledge within the mind of the reader, or listener? The most impressive notion that I have drawn from this week's readings is the inevitable coincidence between information and process. Any piece of information is considerable as such only if it either activates or participates in a process, leading to a result – an output – that is no longer the same original datum, or input, that it acquired at the beginning. In discussing the prodigious qualities of embryonic matter, Von Uexküll (153) is the first to suggest an analogy with literature: the prenatal grafting that he describes resembles, in his comparison, a sudden apparition of words and characters from Shakespeare's Hamlet within the context of Schiller's Wilhelm Tell. If we had to unpack the metaphor, we might initially assert that the two plays correspond to two different species of amphibians, one a carnivore, the second a herbivore; one of the two, Wilhelm Tell, presents a malformation in the genetic locus “monologue”, where an extraneous fragment of stem cells issued an unfamiliar “To be or not to be”. In this reading, the finite specimens would be the plays, and the original genetic matter a sort of unspecified literary paternity (theme? author? language? style?). But at a closer look, the passage might be more problematic: Von Uexküll is speaking about “a great surprise in the theater”, that is, about a specific performance of Wilhelm Tell. The elements of the equation shift: the two specimens are two potential performances of two supposedly distinct plays, and the genetic matter is the textual tradition from which they are staged. Poetry is the code of the performance.

Would it be possible to extend the comparison – this genetically prescriptive power – to any sort of literary artifact? Let us look at Losee's diagram of information (14), as applied to language: if the message received were a declamation of Kubla Khan, would our knowledge of the poem – the collection of pictures and impressions that it shapes in our brain – be hierarchically higher than the poem itself? Does the poem eventually only work as a blueprint for the sensations that it ought to produce?

##Krapp's Reel and Dictionary - Again for the specificity of writing

As I encountered the word "viduity", while reading Beckett's short play, my instinct was precisely the same as the one experienced by the character on stage, old Krapp - my ideal gaze started, interrupted the course of its activity, moved backwards for a moment, and slowly parsed again the unknown term, while I wondered about its meaning. Unlike Krapp, however, I had no need of consulting any dictionary because, as soon as my point of view was lifted from the close progression of the narrative - for the dense stage directions had done just that, they had paradoxically succeeded in transforming the necessarily deficient printed form of a dramatic monologue into the self-sufficient illusion of a narrative -, I realized, just by almost casually glancing at the upcoming lines, that the clarification about the strange word would come to me from the page itself. Had I been watching the piece in a theater, as it was arguably supposed to be enjoyed, my attention would have probably attempted an analogous jump - only to be immediately reincorporated into the flow of the dramatic action by the sympathetic uncertainty displayed by the actor on stage. My connection with the printed version of Beckett's text instead produced a combination of Krapp's "stop-and-rewind" usage of the audio reel with his efficient looking up and skimming through a ledger first and a dictionary later: when it became necessary, the temporal stream of the first was substituted by the spatial overlook of the second.

I think that this alternation between the discrete and the continuous (Weaver 12) and between succession and simultaneity (McLuhan 13) is peculiar to writing, and that it still deserves much consideration. I find it hard to categorize writing - handwriting or print - along other media by following principles of unit (analog or digital - a telephone against a telegraph) or temporality (punctual or durative - a painting against a film), but I believe in the usefulness of this effort, especially when facing the questions posed by the proliferation of new media - which further expand and problematize this ambiguity.
